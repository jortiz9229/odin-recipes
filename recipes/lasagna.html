    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Step 1</strong></li>
            <p>Gather Ingredients</p>
        <li><strong>Step 2</strong></li>
            <p>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over
                medium heat until well browned.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong></li>
            <p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season
                with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning,
                fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 4</strong></li>
            <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling
                water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 5</strong></li>
            <p>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 
                teaspoon salt.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 6</strong></li>
            <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p>
        <li><strong>Step 7</strong></li>
            <p>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch
                baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the 
                ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce
                over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 8</strong></li>
            <p>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.
                Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch
                the cheese.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 9</strong></li>
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</p>
        <li><strong>Step 10</strong></li>
            <p>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</p>
